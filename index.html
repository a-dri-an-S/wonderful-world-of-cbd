            CBD (cannabidiol) is one of several components called cannabinoids that
            is found in both cannabis and hemp plants. This active-ingredient has
            been found to have a whole range of health benefits with therapeutic
            applications. Unlike THC, the main psychoactive canabinoid that is found
            in marijuana, CBD is completely non-psychoactive and will not produce
            the euphoric effect that THC can bring on when consumed. For this
            reason, CBD has gained a significant amount of popularity as an
            alternative to pharmaceuticals for helping manage pain, stress and
            anxiety to name a few.

                In order to understand how CBD works in the body, we must first
                take a look at our own bodies endocannabinoid system (ECS). ECS,
                in short, is a complex signaling system in our body that regulates
                a slew of biological functions. Although, there is still much
                needed research to fully understands all of its functionality,
                what we do know will help in understanding how CBD can work for
                us.
                </p>
                <p>
                ECS produces its own cannabinoids(endocannabinoids) that bind to
                two receptors, CB1 & CB2. The CB1 receptors are mostly found in
                our brain, while the CB2 receptors are mostly located within our
                immune and gastrointestinal system. However, we do have CB1 & CB2
                receptor sites all throughout the body, the main concentration is
                in those specified areas. Depending on where these
                endocannabinoids bind to these receptors, research has linked the
                ECS to the following biological processes:

                So, when CBD enters the body, it influences cannabinoid receptors and
                aids in the production of our body's own endocannabinoids. It
                essentially lends a helping hand to ECS and ensures it keeps things
                running smoothly. Also, CBD has been known to interact with other
                receptors such as our opioid, dopamine and serotonin receptors.

        <h2>How can CBD help?</h2>
        <p>
            Although, there is more research to be done, there is still enough
            evidence to show some of the benefits of supplementing with CBD.

            <h3>Stress & Anxiety</h3>
            <p>
                There is a large amount of anecdotal evidence that claims CBD can
                have a relaxing affect and can aid when dealing with stress and
                anxiety. Some research claims this is caused by influencing the
                activity in our serotonin system.

            <h3>Insomnia</h3>
            <p>
                For those looking to get better, uninterrupted sleep, CBD may be the
                cure for that. The research still isn't clear on how it works, but
                one thing is for sure that it is dose dependant and a larger dose
                tends to work better than a smaller dose. Another thing to keep in
                minds with sleep is sometimes stress and anxiety can affect the
                quality of sleep and the reduction in either can help in getting a
                better nights rets.

            <h3>Pain</h3>
            <p>
                According to research, CBD can help with two types of pain:
                neuropathic (nerve damage) and inflammatory (inflammation of the
                body). For this reason, it is considered a good alternative to
                pharmaceutical pain killers. Also, since its known to bind to opioid
                receptors, it can help in the reduction of opioid intake,as it
                enhances the effects of them.
